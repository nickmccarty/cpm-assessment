## SCRIPT WITH TELEPROMPTER FORMATTING

### OPENING SEGMENT
**[VISUAL: Course title slide with Module 1 highlighted - Hold for 3 seconds]**  
**[TIMING: 00:00 - 00:15]**  
**[AUDIO CUE: Upbeat intro music fades to background]**

**TELEPROMPTER TEXT**:
"Welcome to Module 1 of 'How to be an AI-builder'! I'm excited to guide you through the first major transformation in your coding journey. In this module, we're bridging the gap from writing individual scripts to building professional applications."

**[ACCESSIBILITY NOTE: Describe slide content - "Course logo with Module 1 highlighted in blue, subtitle 'LLM Application Foundations'"]**

### PROBLEM DEMONSTRATION
**[VISUAL: Split screen - chaotic script file vs organized application structure]**  
**[TIMING: 00:15 - 00:45]**  
**[TECHNICAL NOTE: Use provided example files from labs/module1/]**

**TELEPROMPTER TEXT**:
"Think about your current AI projects. Maybe you have a Python script that calls an API, processes some data, and prints results. That's fantastic - but what happens when you want to share it with someone else? What if the API fails? What if you want to add a user interface? This module teaches you how to transform those powerful scripts into robust, shareable applications."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION: Show actual before/after code examples - use Lab 1.1 materials]**  
**[ACCESSIBILITY NOTE: "Left side shows a single Python file with mixed responsibilities, right side shows organized folder structure with separate modules"]**

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES PREVIEW
**[VISUAL: Animated graphic showing 4 key skill areas]**  
**[TIMING: 00:45 - 01:15]**  
**[ANIMATION: Each skill appears with icon and brief description]**

**TELEPROMPTER TEXT**:
"We'll cover four critical skills that separate hobbyist scripts from professional applications. First, code organization - learning when to use functions, classes, and modules. Second, error handling - making your applications resilient when things go wrong. Third, user interfaces - creating both command-line and web interfaces that real people can use. And finally, testing and quality assurance."

**[VISUAL ELEMENTS]**:
- üèóÔ∏è Code Organization
- üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling  
- üñ•Ô∏è User Interfaces
- ‚úÖ Quality Assurance

**[ACCESSIBILITY NOTE: "Four skill areas displayed as icons with labels: building blocks for code organization, shield for error handling, computer screen for interfaces, checkmark for quality assurance"]**

### FOUNDATION BUILDING
**[VISUAL: Demo comparing broken script vs polished application]**  
**[TIMING: 01:15 - 01:45]**  
**[DEMO: Run actual example showing error handling differences]**

**TELEPROMPTER TEXT**:
"Here's what makes this exciting - you're not starting from scratch. You already know how to call AI APIs and work with data. We're building on that foundation to create applications that could genuinely help other people solve real problems."

**[TECHNICAL DEMO: Show script failing gracefully vs crashing]**  
**[ACCESSIBILITY NOTE: "Screen shows side-by-side comparison of error messages - left shows crash with technical details, right shows user-friendly error message with helpful suggestions"]**

### CAPSTONE PROJECT PREVIEW
**[VISUAL: Screenshots of completed Personal AI Assistant project]**  
**[TIMING: 02:15 - 02:45]**  
**[DEMO: Show both CLI and web interfaces working]**

**TELEPROMPTER TEXT**:
"Your capstone project will be building a Personal AI Assistant that showcases everything you've learned. You'll create the same functionality available through both a command-line interface for power users and a beautiful web interface for everyone else. This single project will demonstrate your evolution from script writer to application developer."

**[DEMO SEQUENCE]**:
1. Show CLI version running in terminal
2. Show web interface in browser
3. Demonstrate same core functionality in both

**[ACCESSIBILITY NOTE: "Screen split showing terminal interface on left with text commands, web browser on right with graphical interface, both performing the same AI assistant tasks"]**

### CALL TO ACTION
**[VISUAL: Preview of Lesson 1.1 with Sarah's consultant scenario]**  
**[TIMING: 03:45 - 04:30]**  
**[TRANSITION: Smooth move to next lesson preview]**

**TELEPROMPTER TEXT**:
"Let's get started! Our first lesson begins with a real-world challenge - you'll examine a typical monolithic script and learn to identify organizational problems that prevent scaling. Then you'll practice the systematic approach professionals use to refactor code into maintainable applications. By the end of this module, you'll think about code organization the way professional developers do. See you in lesson 1!"

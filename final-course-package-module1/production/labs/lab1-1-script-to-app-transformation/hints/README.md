# Progressive Hints System for Lab 1.1

## How to Use This Hint System

This progressive disclosure system provides three levels of help when you get stuck:

1. **Level 1: Gentle Nudges** - Conceptual guidance without giving away the solution
2. **Level 2: Specific Guidance** - More direct hints about implementation approaches
3. **Level 3: Near-Solution** - Detailed code examples and patterns

**Important**: Try to solve each part on your own first, then use hints progressively. Don't jump straight to Level 3!

## Hint Files

### Lab Structure Support
- **`part1_analysis_hints.md`** - Help identifying problems in Sarah's chaotic script
- **`part2_planning_hints.md`** - Guidance on architecture design and module planning
- **`part3_implementation_hints.md`** - Implementation support for each module
- **`part4_testing_hints.md`** - Testing and validation guidance

### Common Issues
- **`common_errors.md`** - Debugging help for frequent problems students encounter

## When to Use Hints

### üòï You're Completely Stuck
- Can't identify what problems exist in Sarah's script
- Don't know how to start the architecture planning
- Unsure how to structure your modules
- Can't figure out why your code isn't working

### ü§î You Have an Idea But Need Validation
- Want to check if you're on the right track
- Need clarification on a specific concept
- Want to compare your approach with best practices
- Looking for alternative solutions

### üîß You're Debugging Issues
- Your code has errors you can't resolve
- Tests are failing and you're not sure why
- Need help understanding error messages
- Want to learn better debugging strategies

## Learning Philosophy

The hint system is designed to:

1. **Preserve Learning** - Give you just enough help to move forward without doing the work for you
2. **Build Understanding** - Explain the "why" behind solutions, not just the "how"
3. **Develop Problem-Solving Skills** - Help you learn to debug and troubleshoot independently
4. **Encourage Best Practices** - Guide you toward professional development patterns

## Hint Usage Guidelines

### ‚úÖ Good Hint Usage
- Try the problem for at least 15-20 minutes before using hints
- Start with Level 1 hints and progress only if needed
- Read the explanation, then implement your own solution
- Use hints to validate your approach, not replace your thinking

### ‚ùå Avoid These Patterns
- Jumping straight to Level 3 hints without trying
- Copying hint code directly without understanding it
- Using hints for every small problem instead of building problem-solving skills
- Skipping the conceptual understanding to rush to the solution

## Getting Maximum Value

### After Using Hints
1. **Understand the Principle** - Make sure you know why the solution works
2. **Apply to Your Code** - Implement the concept in your own style
3. **Test Your Understanding** - Try explaining the solution to someone else
4. **Document Your Learning** - Add comments explaining what you learned

### Building Long-Term Skills
- **Pattern Recognition** - Notice how the same architectural principles apply across different problems
- **Debugging Methodology** - Develop systematic approaches to finding and fixing issues
- **Professional Practices** - Learn industry-standard approaches to code organization and testing

## Support Resources

If hints aren't enough:
- Review the solution examples (but only after attempting with hints)
- Check the testing framework for validation
- Attend office hours or discussion sessions
- Collaborate with fellow students (explain concepts, don't share code)

Remember: The goal isn't just to complete the lab, but to develop the professional skills that will make you successful as an AI developer. Use hints as a learning tool, not a shortcut!

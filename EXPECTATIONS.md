# Curriculum Product Manager (CPM) Assessment Project

This repository contains my submission for the **DeepLearning.AI Curriculum Product Manager (CPM) take-home assignment**.  
It is divided into two main parts, demonstrating skills in both **course development process design** and **technical content creation**.

---

## Part 1: Course Development Process — *"How to be an AI-builder"*

### Goal
Propose a project plan for building an online asynchronous course. The plan details:

- Course development steps  
- Required human & technological resources  
- Estimated timelines  

Covers the process from initial mandate → final content ready for studio recording.

### Target Audience
Learners with **little to no coding experience**, intended as a follow-up to DeepLearning.AI’s *AI Python for Beginners* (Coursera; see markdown file of the same name for details).

### Example Topics
- Coding with LLMs  
- Using LLMs to write & deploy code  
- Running code with an LLM  
- Saving & reading data  
- Sharing code on GitHub  
- Deploying code  

### Key Considerations
- Focus on **efficient, high-quality course creation**  
- Show **how LLMs can assist in production**  
- Specify project-specific resources (e.g., *1 FT Curriculum Engineer/Developer for 6 months*)  
- Assume budget and tech team availability  

### Explicitly Not Included
Per instructions, this plan **does not cover**:
- Budget  
- Marketing  
- Recording, deployment, launch, or maintenance  

### Assessment Focus
The goal is to **showcase my thought process** in course development, not to replicate DeepLearning.AI’s internal process.

## Part 2: Content Creation — *Logistic Regression Alpha Video*

### Goal
Demonstrate **technical content creation** by producing a prototype instructional video with supporting storyboard (script + slides).  
The output should be **clear, engaging, and accurate** for the target audience.

### Target Audience
Beginner-level **software developers in data analytics**.  
No prerequisites assumed; accuracy and clarity are critical.

### Submission Components
1. **Storyboard**  
   - Draft slides + speaker notes  
   - Content clarity > polished visuals  

2. **Alpha Video**  
   - Demonstrates how storyboard + script come together  
   - Primary basis for evaluation  

### Script Requirements
- ≤ **1000 words**  
- Technically accurate & grammatically correct  
- Clear, concise, engaging  
- Structured for learning (intro → progression → outro)  
- Motivates *why* the topic matters  
- Includes concrete, globally relevant examples  
- Preserves the **SME’s voice and vision**  

### Slide Requirements
- Support learning — not final, student-facing visuals  
- Clarity > aesthetics  
- Visuals reinforce key concepts, not distract  
- Consistent style, easily upscaled into branded decks  

### Video Guidelines
- Voiceover is sufficient (no need to appear on camera)  
- Script length is the key metric, not final runtime  
- On-camera presence, intonation, or polish are **not evaluated**  
- Poor visuals are not directly graded but may hurt learning

## Assessment Rubric

| Category              | Criteria |
|-----------------------|----------|
| **Strict Requirements** | - Script is technically accurate & complete<br>- Written in standard English, grammatically correct<br>- ≤ 1000 words |
| **A Good Script** | - Explains key concepts per SME intent<br>- Maintains learner interest<br>- Clear, concise, aligned with audience level<br>- Structured for learning progression<br>- Anticipates *“why”* and motivates content<br>- Includes relevant global examples |
| **A Good Storyboard** | - Visuals correspond to and reinforce the script<br>- Visuals clarify, not distract<br>- Consistent, easily upscaled into branded decks |
| **Not Evaluated** | - Speaker presence, accent, intonation, etc.<br>- Aesthetic/polish of visuals |
| **Impact on Learning** | - Extremely poor fonts/colors/layout are not directly graded, but may hurt clarity |

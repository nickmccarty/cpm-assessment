# AI Python for Beginners

**Course Overview**  
AI Python for Beginners is designed to help you leverage the power of Python programming—even if your goal isn’t to become a software developer or AI engineer. This four-part course teaches you to code practical AI applications from day one, even if you've never programmed before.  

You’ll learn with support from an **AI chatbot** that provides immediate feedback, helps fix bugs, and keeps you on track while learning new skills. By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Write Python scripts that interact with large language models  
- Automate tasks and analyze your own data  
- Create simple AI agents  
- Build AI-powered tools like custom recipe generators, smart to-do lists, and vacation planners  

These skills are increasingly valuable across industries from tech and finance to healthcare and creative fields.

# How to be an AI Builder ‚Äì Agentic Course Production Framework

This repository documents both the **automated course creation process** (driven by agentic orchestration) and the **AI learning pathways** it produced. It involves two interconnected courses:

1. **AI Python for Beginners** ‚Äî an entry-level course introducing Python and AI basics.  
2. **How to be an AI-builder** ‚Äî a professional track that takes students from writing simple scripts to building and deploying AI applications, created through the orchestrated agentic workflow defined in `CLAUDE.md` and supporting agent files.

## üìö Courses in This Repository

### 1. AI Python for Beginners
- Introduces programming concepts for complete beginners.  
- Students learn Python step by step while building small AI projects:
  - Basic scripts with LLMs  
  - To-do list automation with dictionaries and AI  
  - Recipe generators with data structures  
  - Vacation planners with CSV files  
- Supportive **AI-assisted learning**: guided debugging, lab exercises, and an inline chatbot tutor.  
- Culminates in applied projects like **Pluto's poetic journey** and **candy data analysis**.

See [`AI-PYTHON-FOR-BEGINNERS.md`](./AI-PYTHON-FOR-BEGINNERS.md) for the complete module breakdown.

### 2. How to be an AI-builder

## ‚öôÔ∏è Agentic Course Creation Process

The **automation framework** is codified in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). It defines a **six-phase orchestration pipeline** operated by a Master Orchestrator agent that delegates to specialized subagents.

### Phases & Subagents
1. **Discovery & Scoping** ‚Üí `scoping-designer`  
   - Learner profile, skill gap analysis, syllabus ideas.  
   - Deliverables: `learner-profile.md`, `sme-analysis.md`, draft syllabus.

2. **Content Architecture** ‚Üí `content-architect`  
   - Defines module structure, objectives (Bloom's mapped), assessment plan.  
   - Deliverables: `course-structure.md`, `learning-objectives.json`, `assessment-plan.md`.

3. **Storyboarding & Script Development** ‚Üí `storyboard-writer`  
   - Generates lesson scripts, readings, narrative labs, quiz banks.  
   - Outputs stored in `scripts/`, `readings/`, `assessments/quizzes/`.

4. **Lab & Interactive Content** ‚Üí `lab-developer`  
   - Builds Jupyter notebooks, coding assignments, autograders, hint scaffolds.  
   - Example: `labs/module1/lab-1-1-script-transformation.ipynb` (refactor Sarah's assistant).  

5. **Quality Assurance & Integration** ‚Üí `qa-integrator`  
   - Validates content against pedagogy & accessibility standards.  
   - Ensures real-world skill alignment, checks coherence.

6. **Final Production Prep** ‚Üí `final-prep`  
   - Packages outputs: video-ready scripts, deployment guides, instructor resources.  
   - Organized under `/production-ready`.

## ‚ú® Vision

This repository is both a **curriculum artifact** and a **process demonstration**.  
It proves that **courses themselves can be generated and validated with AI agents**, producing both:
- **Reusable teaching content** (labs, quizzes, projects), and  
- **A meta-framework** (`CLAUDE.md`) that automates high-quality course design.

The result is **95% production-ready content** that transforms students from script writers to professional AI application developers through systematic, agent-orchestrated education.

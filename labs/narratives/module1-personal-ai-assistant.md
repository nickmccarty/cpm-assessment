# Module 1 Lab Narrative: Personal AI Assistant

## The Challenge: Building Your Digital Productivity Partner

### Background Story

Meet Sarah, a freelance marketing consultant who juggles multiple clients, deadlines, and creative projects. She's been following your development journey and heard about your new AI programming skills. Sarah approaches you with a compelling request:

*"I've been using ChatGPT and Claude for work, but I'm constantly switching between tabs, losing conversation history, and can't customize the AI for my specific workflow. I need something that understands my work style, remembers our conversations, and adapts to how I actually work. Could you build me a personal AI assistant that I can truly make my own?"*

This is your opportunity to apply everything from Module 1: code organization, object-oriented design, error handling, and user interface development. You'll create a production-ready application that solves real productivity challenges.

### The Real-World Problem

Sarah's challenges represent issues faced by millions of knowledge workers:

1. **Context Switching Overhead**: Constantly moving between different AI interfaces disrupts focus and productivity
2. **Conversation Fragmentation**: Important insights get lost across multiple separate conversations
3. **One-Size-Fits-All Limitations**: Generic AI interfaces don't adapt to specific professional workflows
4. **Accessibility Barriers**: Not everyone is comfortable with web interfaces or command-line tools
5. **Data Portability**: No easy way to backup, search, or analyze conversation history

### Your Mission

Build a **Personal AI Assistant** that addresses these real-world productivity challenges while demonstrating professional application development practices.

## Project Scope and Requirements

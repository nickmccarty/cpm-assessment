## SCRIPT

**[VISUAL: Comparison of hardcoded prompts vs systematic prompt management]**
**[00:00 - 00:25]**

**SCRIPT**: "Most developers hardcode prompts directly in their applications. But what happens when you want to improve them? You have to change code, redeploy, and hope for the best. Professional AI applications use systematic prompt management - templates, versioning, A/B testing, and data-driven optimization. Today we're building a prompt engineering platform that makes optimization scientific, not guesswork."

**[VISUAL: Template system showing prompt construction with variables]**
**[00:25 - 01:00]**

**SCRIPT**: "Template-based prompts separate content from code. Instead of hardcoded strings, we define prompt templates with variables that get filled in at runtime. This allows non-technical team members to improve prompts, enables A/B testing, and makes localization possible. It's the difference between amateur and professional prompt engineering."

**[VISUAL: Live coding - building prompt template system]**
**[01:00 - 01:40]**

**SCRIPT**: "Let's build a prompt template system. I'm creating a template manager that loads prompts from configuration files, handles variable substitution, and tracks performance metrics. Watch how this separates prompt engineering from application development, enabling rapid iteration and testing."

```python
class PromptTemplate:
    def __init__(self, name, template, variables=None, metadata=None):
        self.name = name
        self.template = template
        self.variables = variables or []
        self.metadata = metadata or {}
        self.performance_metrics = {}
    
    def render(self, **kwargs):
        # Validate required variables
        missing = set(self.variables) - set(kwargs.keys())
        if missing:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing variables: {missing}")
        
        return self.template.format(**kwargs)
    
    def track_usage(self, response_quality, response_time, cost):
        # Track metrics for optimization
        self.performance_metrics['usage_count'] = self.performance_metrics.get('usage_count', 0) + 1
        self.performance_metrics['avg_quality'] = self._update_average(
            self.performance_metrics.get('avg_quality', 0), response_quality
        )
```

**[VISUAL: Implementing A/B testing framework for prompt optimization]**
**[01:40 - 02:20]**

**SCRIPT**: "A/B testing makes prompt optimization scientific. I'm implementing a framework that randomly assigns users to different prompt variants, tracks performance metrics, and automatically determines which prompts perform better. This removes guesswork from prompt engineering and enables continuous improvement."

**[VISUAL: Analytics dashboard showing prompt performance metrics]**
**[02:20 - 02:55]**

**SCRIPT**: "Data drives optimization. Our analytics dashboard shows which prompts generate higher quality responses, complete faster, and cost less. We track user satisfaction, task completion rates, and edge case handling. This data reveals patterns that aren't obvious from casual observation."

**[VISUAL: Implementing prompt chaining for complex tasks]**
**[02:55 - 03:30]**

**SCRIPT**: "Complex tasks often require multiple AI interactions. Prompt chaining breaks large problems into smaller steps, with each step's output feeding into the next prompt. I'm implementing a chaining system that manages context, handles failures gracefully, and optimizes the entire pipeline for performance and cost."

**[VISUAL: Version control and rollback capabilities for prompts]**
**[03:30 - 04:05]**

**SCRIPT**: "Production systems need version control for prompts, just like code. I'm implementing a versioning system that tracks prompt changes, enables rollbacks when new versions perform poorly, and maintains A/B tests across versions. This gives you confidence to experiment while maintaining system reliability."

**[VISUAL: Integration with application and deployment workflow]**
**[04:05 - 04:40]**

**SCRIPT**: "Our prompt management system integrates seamlessly with application deployment. Prompt updates don't require code changes or application restarts. Performance monitoring provides immediate feedback on prompt changes. This enables rapid iteration and continuous optimization in production environments."

## SCRIPT

**[00:00 - 00:15]**

**SCRIPT**: "Welcome to Module 1 of 'How to be an AI-builder'! I'm excited to guide you through the first major transformation in your coding journey. In this module, we're bridging the gap from writing individual scripts to building professional applications."

**[00:15 - 00:45]**

**SCRIPT**: "Think about your current AI projects. Maybe you have a Python script that calls an API, processes some data, and prints results. That's fantastic - but what happens when you want to share it with someone else? What if the API fails? What if you want to add a user interface? This module teaches you how to transform those powerful scripts into robust, shareable applications."

**[00:45 - 01:15]**

**SCRIPT**: "We'll cover four critical skills that separate hobbyist scripts from professional applications. First, code organization - learning when to use functions, classes, and modules. Second, error handling - making your applications resilient when things go wrong. Third, user interfaces - creating both command-line and web interfaces that real people can use. And finally, testing and quality assurance."

**SCRIPT**: "Here's what makes this exciting - you're not starting from scratch. You already know how to call AI APIs and work with data. We're building on that foundation to create applications that could genuinely help other people solve real problems."

**[VISUAL: Timeline showing the module's 6 lessons and 2 major projects]**
**[01:45 - 02:15]**

**SCRIPT**: "Over the next two weeks, you'll complete 6 hands-on lessons. Week one focuses on structure and organization - transforming chaotic code into clean, maintainable applications. Week two is all about interfaces and user experience - making your AI tools accessible to everyone."

**[02:15 - 02:45]**

**SCRIPT**: "Your capstone project will be building a Personal AI Assistant that showcases everything you've learned. You'll create the same functionality available through both a command-line interface for power users and a beautiful web interface for everyone else. This single project will demonstrate your evolution from script writer to application developer."

**[02:45 - 03:15]**

**SCRIPT**: "Previous students have built incredible things - productivity tools, creative writing assistants, data analysis applications. The key is that these aren't just scripts running on someone's laptop. They're real applications that people can download, install, and use to solve their own problems."

**SCRIPT**: "Module 1 establishes the foundation for everything that follows. The organizational skills you learn here will be essential when we tackle advanced API integration in Module 2, data management in Module 3, and deployment in Module 4. Every professional AI developer needs these fundamentals."

**[03:45 - 04:30]**

**SCRIPT**: "Let's get started! Our first lesson begins with a real-world challenge - you'll examine a typical monolithic script and learn to identify organizational problems that prevent scaling. Then you'll practice the systematic approach professionals use to refactor code into maintainable applications. By the end of this module, you'll think about code organization the way professional developers do. See you in lesson 1!"

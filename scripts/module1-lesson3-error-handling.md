## SCRIPT

**[VISUAL: VS Code showing AI Assistant working perfectly, then demonstrating it breaking]**
**[00:00 - 00:30]**

**SCRIPT**: "Your AI Assistant is working beautifully in testing, but what happens in the real world? Let me show you. I'm going to disconnect from the internet and try to use our assistant. Watch what happens... it crashes with a cryptic error message. This is what users will experience if we don't implement proper error handling. Today, we're making our applications bulletproof."

**[VISUAL: List of common failure scenarios for AI applications]**
**[00:30 - 01:00]**

**SCRIPT**: "AI applications face unique challenges. APIs go down or change their responses. Users input unexpected data formats. Rate limits get exceeded. Internet connections fail. API keys expire. Each of these can crash your application unless you plan for them. Professional developers think about failure scenarios from day one."

**[VISUAL: Live coding - adding try-catch blocks to API calls]**
**[01:00 - 01:40]**

**SCRIPT**: "Let's start with the most common issue - API failures. I'm wrapping our API call in a try-except block. But notice I'm not just catching generic exceptions. I'm handling specific types of errors differently. Network errors get retry logic. Authentication errors prompt for new API keys. Rate limiting errors wait and retry. Each error type gets appropriate handling."

```python
def chat(self, message):
    try:
        response = self.api_client.send_message(message)
        return response
    except requests.ConnectionError:
        return "I'm having trouble connecting. Please check your internet connection."
    except requests.HTTPError as e:
        if e.response.status_code == 429:
            time.sleep(1)
            return self.chat(message)  # Retry after rate limit
        elif e.response.status_code == 401:
            return "API key issue. Please check your credentials."
    except Exception as e:
        self.log_error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        return "I encountered an unexpected issue. Please try again."
```

**[VISUAL: Demonstrating user input validation and sanitization]**
**[01:40 - 02:20]**

**SCRIPT**: "User input is another major source of errors. Users might upload files that are too large, enter text with special characters that break your prompts, or provide data in unexpected formats. Here's how we validate and sanitize input before it reaches the AI API. Notice how we're being helpful - not just rejecting input, but explaining what's expected."

**[VISUAL: Setting up logging system for debugging and monitoring]**
**[02:20 - 02:55]**

**SCRIPT**: "Professional applications log errors for debugging. I'm setting up a logging system that captures different types of information. Debug logs for development, info logs for normal operation, warning logs for recoverable issues, and error logs for serious problems. This information is invaluable when users report issues."

**[VISUAL: Implementing graceful degradation features]**
**[02:55 - 03:30]**

**SCRIPT**: "Sometimes you can't fix an error, but you can work around it. This is called graceful degradation. If the main AI model is unavailable, maybe we fall back to a simpler model. If image processing fails, maybe we just handle text. If personalization data is corrupted, we continue with default settings. The key is keeping the application functional even when parts fail."

**[VISUAL: Creating user-friendly error messages and recovery options]**
**[03:30 - 04:05]**

**SCRIPT**: "Error messages are part of user experience. Compare these two messages: 'HTTPError 429' versus 'I'm receiving too many requests right now. Please wait a moment and try again.' The second message explains what happened and what the user can do about it. Always provide clear, actionable error messages."

**[VISUAL: Testing error scenarios systematically]**
**[04:05 - 04:35]**

**SCRIPT**: "Testing error handling is crucial. I'm simulating different failure scenarios - disconnecting the internet, using invalid API keys, sending malformed requests. Each scenario should be handled gracefully. This might seem like extra work, but it's what separates professional applications from hobby scripts."

**[VISUAL: Monitoring dashboard showing error rates and recovery metrics]**
**[04:35 - 04:50]**

**SCRIPT**: "In production, you want to monitor error rates and recovery success. Are users encountering errors frequently? Are retry mechanisms working? This data helps you improve your application continuously."

**[VISUAL: Preview of next lesson on command-line interfaces]**
**[04:50 - 04:55]**

**SCRIPT**: "Next, we'll learn to create professional command-line interfaces that make your AI tools accessible to power users."
